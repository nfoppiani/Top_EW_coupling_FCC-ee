\subsection{20/07/2015}
The first day we did a lot of burocracy. It's not necessary to register the car, our badge permits us to pass.

During the afternoon we have attended to a conference during which our tutors have presented the projects.

I will work with Tommaso in a project about the top electromagnetic coupling.
