1. Plotted the number of rc muons per event (countMuonsPerEvent.py)
2. Plotted the angle (in degrees) between the rc muons and the mc muons for the events with three or more muons (countMuonsPerEvent.py). Decided the cut for matching to be 7Â°.

JET APPROACH

The idea to use the minimum angle with respect to the six jets is far worse than using pt.
Also using only the electron whose minimum pt with respect to a jet is maximum works worse than using the electron whose pt from the nearest jet is maximum (it might be theta = pi)
