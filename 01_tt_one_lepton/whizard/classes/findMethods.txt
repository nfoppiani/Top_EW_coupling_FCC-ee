### MUONS ###
#############

1. Plotted the number of rc muons per event (countMuonsPerEvent.py)
2. Plotted the angle (in degrees) between the rc muons and the mc W-decay-muon for the events with three or more muons. Closest muon is plotted in red, others in green  (countMuonsPerEvent.py). Decided the maximum angle to match to be 5.5Â°.

### PHOTONS RECOVERY ###

dtheta1Degrees = 0.4		photonsRecovery.root
dphi1Degrees = 0.2
dtheta2Degrees = 0.27
dphi2DegreesMax = 2.7
dphi2DegreesMin = -0.2

dtheta1Degrees = 0.5		photonsRecovery1.root		BETTER!
dphi1Degrees = 0.5
dtheta2Degrees = 0.28
dphi2DegreesMax = 2.7
dphi2DegreesMin = -0.2

dtheta1Degrees = 0.8		photonsRecovery1.root		BEST!
dphi1Degrees = 0.8
dtheta2Degrees = 0.4
dphi2DegreesMax = 4.0
dphi2DegreesMin = -0.4

### JETS SELECTION ###





JET APPROACH

The idea to use the minimum angle with respect to the six jets is far worse than using pt.
Also using only the electron whose minimum pt with respect to a jet is maximum works worse than using the electron whose pt from the nearest jet is maximum (it might be theta = pi)
